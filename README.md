# Notable Growth Liquid Snippets

A collection of helpful Liquid code snippets compiled by Notable Growth. These snippets are intended for use with [Braze](https://braze.com). 

As Braze uses a forked version of Liquid, the code in these snippets may not work with other services that also use Liquid.
